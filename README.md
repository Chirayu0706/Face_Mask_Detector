# Face_Mask_Detector
This project uses a Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people with and without masks. The CNN manages to get an accuracy of 99.9% on the training set and 98.9% on the test set. Then the stored weights of this CNN are used to classify as mask or no mask, in real time, using OpenCV. With the webcam capturing the video, the frames are preprocessed and and fed to the model to accomplish this task. The model works efficiently with no apparent lag time between wearing/removing mask and display of prediction.

# Dataset
The Dataset has been uploaded to Github. Its a dataset Split in 2 categories [With Mask] and [Without Mask]
With Mask Folder has 1915 Pictures.
Without Mask Folder has 1918 Pictures.

### The Project is now ready to use !!
